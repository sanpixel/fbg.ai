# Fantasy Team Optimizer (fbg.ai) TODO

## Core Development

### Data Management System
- [ ] **CSV Data Loading**
  - Implement CSV file reader with pandas
  - Validate required columns (Name, Position, Price, ProjectedPoints)
  - Handle missing data and data type conversions
  - Add error handling for malformed CSV files

- [ ] **Player Data Structure**
  - Create player class/dataclass for structured data
  - Implement position validation (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF)
  - Add data filtering and sorting capabilities
  - Support for player statistics display

### Optimization Engine

- [ ] **Team Selection Algorithm**
  - Implement lineup constraint logic (1 QB, 1 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 DEF, 2 FLEX, 1 BENCH)
  - Create budget constraint enforcement ($200 max)
  - Develop optimization algorithm (greedy or linear programming)
  - Maximize projected points within constraints

- [ ] **Algorithm Options**
  - Research linear programming approach (PuLP or scipy.optimize)
  - Implement greedy algorithm as fallback/comparison
  - Add performance benchmarking for large player pools
  - Optimize for sub-2 second execution time

### Streamlit User Interface

- [ ] **Main Dashboard**
  - Create clean layout with Streamlit components
  - Add file upload widget for CSV data
  - Display current budget and remaining funds
  - Show total projected points for selected team

- [ ] **Team Display**
  - Create position-based team roster display
  - Show player names, positions, prices, and projected points
  - Add visual indicators for lineup requirements
  - Display FLEX position eligibility clearly

- [ ] **Interactive Controls**
  - Budget adjustment slider/input
  - Team optimization trigger button
  - Manual player selection override options
  - Reset/clear team functionality

### Data Validation & Error Handling

- [ ] **Input Validation**
  - Verify CSV format and required columns
  - Validate price and projected points are numeric
  - Check position abbreviations match expected values
  - Handle duplicate player names

- [ ] **Constraint Validation**
  - Ensure lineup meets position requirements
  - Validate budget constraints are never exceeded
  - Check for minimum/maximum players per position
  - Handle edge cases (insufficient players for position)

## Advanced Features

### Optimization Enhancements
- [ ] **Multiple Lineup Generation**
  - Generate top 3-5 optimal lineups
  - Show different combinations within same budget
  - Allow comparison between lineup options
  - Add diversity constraints to avoid similar teams

- [ ] **Sensitivity Analysis**
  - Show impact of budget changes on team quality
  - Display player replacement suggestions
  - Calculate value-per-dollar metrics
  - Highlight optimal budget allocation points

### User Experience Improvements
- [ ] **Data Persistence**
  - Save/load team configurations
  - Store user preferences (budget, constraints)
  - Export optimized teams to CSV/Excel
  - Session state management in Streamlit

- [ ] **Advanced Filtering**
  - Filter players by price range
  - Sort by projected points, value, position
  - Search players by name
  - Filter by custom criteria

### Performance & Scalability
- [ ] **Large Dataset Handling**
  - Optimize for 500+ player datasets
  - Implement data caching strategies
  - Add progress bars for long operations
  - Memory usage optimization

- [ ] **Algorithm Performance**
  - Benchmark different optimization approaches
  - Add parallel processing for multiple lineups
  - Cache frequently used calculations
  - Implement early termination for infeasible solutions

## Testing & Validation

### Unit Testing
- [ ] **Algorithm Testing**
  - Test constraint satisfaction
  - Validate budget calculations
  - Test edge cases (insufficient players, over budget)
  - Performance testing with large datasets

- [ ] **Data Processing Testing**
  - CSV parsing with various formats
  - Data validation with malformed inputs
  - Position mapping and validation
  - Error handling verification

### Integration Testing
- [ ] **End-to-End Testing**
  - Complete workflow from CSV upload to team generation
  - UI interaction testing
  - Budget constraint enforcement
  - Lineup requirement satisfaction

### User Testing
- [ ] **Usability Testing**
  - Interface intuitiveness
  - Error message clarity
  - Performance on different devices
  - Accessibility considerations

## Deployment & Distribution

### Local Development
- [ ] **Development Environment**
  - Set up proper Python environment with requirements.txt
  - Add development/debugging configurations
  - Create sample data files for testing
  - Document setup and installation process

### Streamlit Deployment
- [ ] **Cloud Deployment**
  - Deploy to Streamlit Cloud or similar platform
  - Configure environment variables and secrets
  - Set up continuous deployment from repository
  - Add monitoring and error tracking
